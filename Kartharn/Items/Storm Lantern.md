_Wondrous Item, Uncommon_

This lantern is crafted from blackened iron and stormglass panels. When lit, the flame inside flickers with silver-blue light and emits a faint hum like distant thunder. Water droplets bead along the glass but never wet the flame.


### **Properties**

- The lantern can be lit with a simple action and burns indefinitely while attuned.
- While lit, the lantern sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

### **Fog-Seer**

- The lantern allows you to **see clearly through natural and magical fog or mist** within **60 feet**.
- Creatures, objects, and terrain hidden by fog appear as **clear silhouettes**, ignoring the visual concealment normally caused by fog, smoke, or light mist.
- If you look through the lantern’s light at creatures or objects beyond 60 feet in fog, they appear **blurred, but still partially visible**, giving you advantage on **Wisdom (Perception) checks** to detect them.
