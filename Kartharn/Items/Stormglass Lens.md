_Wondrous item, common_

This small circular lens is made of cloudy crystal threaded with faint, frozen lightning scars. It is always cool to the touch, and mist beads across its surface when weather is about to turn.

**While looking through the lens:**

- You can tell whether **natural weather within 10 miles** will remain calm or turn stormy in the next **8 hours**.
- Approaching storms appear as vague distortions—no details, only **presence and direction**.
- You gain advantage on **Wisdom (Survival)** checks made to predict or prepare for weather-related hazards.
