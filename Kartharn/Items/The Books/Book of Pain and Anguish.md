## Description
A vestige of a eldritch being, it seems to be the answer to the players' pain and suffering. When near the presence of the book, if it is unattuned, the player(s) receive a vision of this. They must succeed on a **Wisdom Intelligence or Constitution** saving throw of **17+** or they read the book.

## Abilities
Malignance: 1.

Once each day, the player must inflict pain and suffering in correspondence to the following table to an individual by the start of their next long rest, if they do not, increase the books malignance by 1, and they receive a punishment at the end of their long rest. Otherwise subtract it by 1. 

Players also get a bonus per day they choose to not perform the act. These stack with each other.
