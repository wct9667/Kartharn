## Description
A dark and stormy place. Herthambe is a small fishing town on an isolated rocky coastline. The dark cold winters and frequent storms make this town a treacherous place to live. The townsfolk make a living off of the summer trade routes by water, and whaling and fishing when the water is not iced over. A small wall and shabby keep make up the center of the town, providing defense from pirate raids.
