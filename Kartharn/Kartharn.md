## Gods and Mythos
Multiple pantheons exist within Kartharn - the weave created the standard gods of the plane. The eldritch gods are of unknown origin, and seek utter domination of the world. 

### Eldritch
The eldritch deities are outsiders. They view this world with impunity and seek domination, and arrived to sow suffering and chaos. The ONE arrived and was defeated and trapped by the other gods, splitting into multiple different deities representing different ills.


### Weave
The gods of Kartharn were created with the world, from the weave, the threads of reality. They each embody different parts of the world that they were created from.
