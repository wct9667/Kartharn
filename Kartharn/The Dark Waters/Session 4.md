# Session 3 — Dark Waters

## Session Summary
> Party explored [[Stormbeacon]]

## Opening 
- Party is waking up within the shipwreck of the ferry.


## Locations
- [[Herthambe]]
- [[Stormbeacon]]


## Encounters

## Island – Lighthouse Grounds

**Overview:**  
The lighthouse looms silent. No smoke, no light, no movement.

### Encounter: The Empty Keeper’s Quarters

- Meals are half-eaten and rotting.
- Two beds are unmade, the keepers left in a hurry.
- A logbook records strange sightings:  _“Lights beneath the waves… not reflections.”_

**Twist:** Footprints lead out the back door—**toward the sea**, not the path inland.


## Island – Sea Caves - Skull Symbol

**Overview:**  
Jagged caves beneath the cliffs are accessible at low tide.

### Encounter: Echoes Below

- The caves hum faintly, like singing carried by water.
- Personal items of the missing are piled in strange patterns.
- Strange markings on the stone  spirals
- The party may be ambushed by **merfolk scouts**

The merfolk are sabotaging the lighthouse to make the waters unsafe for surface travel.

## Island – The Broken Light

**Overview:**  
Inside the lighthouse’s lantern room.

### Encounter: Sabotage and Ritual

- The lens has been deliberately cracked.
- Ritual carvings line the walls.


## Notes

- Orc is slowly dying, nothing the party can do. 
- Sir Bartavious - gives everyone shit, just wants out of the situation
- Found the living quarters of the lighthouse keepers
- Spiral made from driftwood in one of the buildings
- Barracks again had the symbol - found a diary
	- entries were normal, then got works
	- a keeper went missing at the caves to the northeast
	- Another went missing, and the keeper sent their only raven to the mainland - last entry
- [[Rurik]] found a ring  within a cellar of the building in the middle of the island
