## Backstory
Meriel was a high elf living with her father ([[Ruith Amakiir]]), mother ([[Siraye Amakiir]]), and her older sister ([[Lyra Amakiir]]). She comes from a line of draconic sorcerers as far back as her family can remember. However her magic is uncontrollable (wild magic) and not like the rest of the families. Her parents favor her sister over her and often neglect teaching her the way they do her sister. She wants to prove herself to her family and strives to be better than her sister one day if she can ever learn to control her magic. So when she finds a book of old eldritch chaotic magic buried in her family library she takes it. However things don’t go the way she was expecting. The magic contained in the book [[Book of Terror and Chaos]] was too powerful, overwhelming her and turning her into an infernal being. She grew horns and a tail, her hair turned dark, scales formed all over her body, and spikes popped up around her joints. Her family was horrified and cast her out from their home. With nowhere to go she just kept walking north hoping to find a solution or a new home.
