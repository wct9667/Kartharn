Hailing from the Kingdom of [[Blackspire]], Fredrick is the prince and son of King [[Malrec Blackspire]]. Fredrick's mother died when he was very young and only remembers distant memories of her. Occasionally when the world is still enough he can still hear her voice in the whisper of the wind. She was a good woman from one of the neighboring cities and her death brought on a new darkness for the king and the kingdom. Malbrec's rule is no kind one and Fredrick knows it and because of this, he has little love for his father but knows his death would plummet his ancient kingdom into chaos. It was for this reason that when a mysterious illness fell upon the king that, to preserve the stability of his house and to prove his valor, he was sent to find a cure. Fredrick is aware that this is also most likely a power play by the other noble houses in the blackspirian kingdom.

After his mother's death, Fredrick was raised primarily by the servants of his house and Fredrick's father was distant and held unrealistic standards for his son. Fredrick was trained by royal battle master [[Lautrec]] whom he looks up to as a sort of father figure.
