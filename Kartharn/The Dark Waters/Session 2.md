# Session 2 — Dark Waters

## Session Summary
> Party gets more into town, and starts on the first quest.

## Opening 
- Everyone is in different buildings and will be exploring, eventually coalescing.


## Locations
- [[Herthambe]]
- [[Stormbeacon]]


## Encounters

### Town - Random Interactions
#### Overview
Players will explore town and talk to various NPC characters, learning about the town and its troubles. These interactions will be dependent on what the players decide to do in town.

### Guard - Taken to [[Calder Vane]]
#### Overview
Guards will appear to take the party to [[Calder Vane]]. If they refuse they will be taken with force, otherwise they will be escorted to the keep. If the players have done something to warrant arrest, this will be used as leverage. 

Calder will explain the [[Stormbeacon]] situation, where the lighthouse has been silent for a week and they need help.
