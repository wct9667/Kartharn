## Overview

The Empire of Light was once a grand power in the world, imposing its will upon every other state in Kartharn. It has passed its golden age, and is on a decline, both in population and reputation. Other nations are reclaiming their lost lands from ancient conquests, and taking advantage of the dying empire. Despite this, life within the empire couldn't be so different, with aristocratic parties, indulgence, and greed. The [[Church of Light]] no longer governing the morals of the masses, opting for wealth and grand expenditure. The empire is largely unpopular both inside and out. 

The Empire derives its magical power from the god [[Ghrian - Light]] whomst is trapped underneath [[Henzan]]. [[Ghrian - Light]] is dying, and the Empires' magical powers are waning however, and this unpredictable weakening and flickering of the light has weakened both the [[Church of Light]] and the military of the Empire.

## Culture & Society
Imperial culture is pompous and aristocratic within its cities, with high society and wealth flowing in from the exploitation of the working classes. Religion plays a role in everyday life for the common man and woman and heavy donations to the [[Church of Light]] are required. Non-humans or imperials are looked upon with disdain and often the target of hate crimes and blamed for the struggles of the dying empire.


## Government & Law
The Empire has a token republican senate, but is truly organized by the two largest factions within the Empire. [[Femetris The Fourth]] and [[Pope Padris]]. The church and the state constantly are at odds for political and military power, leading to a factionalized and weak government. 


## Military & Defense
The Empire's military has gotten increasingly more corrupt and factionalized as its power has waned. The Empire's current military is made mostly of poorly equipped soldiers fighting for various warlords. The army is quite large, but quite disorganized and ill-trained/equipped.
