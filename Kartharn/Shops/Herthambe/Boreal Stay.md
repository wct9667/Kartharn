## Description

The inn is a single story half-timbered building, with a poorly-thatched roof. Accomodations consist of woolen blankets near the hearth. Many of the tables in the common room are used for gambling, where sailors spend all their pay on such and drink.

n a typical night, the clientele as rowdy. On this occasion, there are several other people currently in the tavern. A few of the patrons are playing a game of darts, many more are gambling, and a few are in racuous song. Sitting at a secluded table, there is a mannequin/scarecrow/broom that is dressed up to look like the stereotypical "shady figure in a bar" so frequently talked about in tales of taverns. The bartender has a running tally on a nearby chalkboard to record how many people are tricked by it on a daily basis.
