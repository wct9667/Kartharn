## Description

A desolate yet vastly important island to [[Herthambe]]. This island lies a few knots outside of the port, and has been a sight of many shipwrecks. The enchanted lighthouse prevents vessels from accidently washing ashore, assisting in navigation back to the relatively safe waters of the harbor. 

3 lighthouse keepers occupy the island to maintain the lighthouse. They are resupplied by the ferry, and every half year the keepers return to the mainland and swap with 3 others.
