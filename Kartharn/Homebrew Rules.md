## Brutal Critical
When you roll a natural 20 on an attack role, roll the damage dice as normal and add the maximum damage the dice can roll to that damage. 

## Glancing Blows
When an attack roll matches your armor class, all damage taken from that attack is halved. 

## Exhaustion
Exhaustion has 11 levels (0-10), and levels can be gained by doing various grueling tasks, like going without sleep or walking/running long distances. While Exhausted, each d20 roll you make takes a penalty equal to your exhaustion. Ex. 1 level makes every roll have a minus 1, 5 levels makes every roll have a minus 5. If you reach exhaustion 5, your speed is halved. If you reach exhaustion 10, you die instantly. When you take a long rest, you lose 1 level of exhaustion.
