Humans are the core race of the world of Kartharn. They were the first race created by the gods during the days of creation. 

Humans are hardy, and have spread to every corner of the continent. They make up the primary core of the [[Empire of Light]] and [[Castbia]], and are a strong minority elsewhere.
