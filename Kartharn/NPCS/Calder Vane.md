## Description

Harbormaster **Calder Vane** is a broad-shouldered, iron-backed man with a neatly trimmed gray beard and eyes that never stop measuring worth. He wears spotless oilskins and polished boots, as if daring the storm to touch him. Calder rarely raises his voice—he doesn’t need to. His authority is carried in ledgers, permits, and quiet denials.

To the town, he is order incarnate. To the sea, he is an offense waiting to be corrected.


## Additional Details

- Calder never sails. He claims it is “beneath his station.”  
- Keeps meticulous personal ledgers hidden in a locked harbor office.  
- Works closely with [[Mira Kelm]] to entrap captains in debt.  
- Genuinely believes [[Herthambe]] would collapse without him.  

**Roleplay Tip:**  
Calder never threatens directly. He smiles, offers sympathy, and removes options one by one.
