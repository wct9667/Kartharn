## Description

**Mira Kelm** is a slender woman with an unassuming grace, though her eyes glint with calculation. Her hair is a tangle of dark braids streaked with silver, and her fingers are always ink-stained, as if perpetually marking contracts that bind others. Mira’s smile is warm—but it carries the faint edge of inevitability, like a lock clicking shut.

To the town, she is helpful and organized. To her debtors, she is an unyielding spider, weaving obligations they cannot escape.

## Additional Details

- Specializes in keeping people in cycles of payments and fines, often by exploiting loopholes or forgotten clauses.
- Maintains a ledger larger and more detailed than the harbor master’s, tracking debts, favors, and moral compromises.
- Works in concert with [[Calder Vane]] to ensure captains and merchants remain under control.
- Has a network of informants across [[Herthambe]] who report on those likely to fall into debt.
- Soft-spoken; her persuasion comes in questions, suggestions, and “helpful” reminders rather than threats.
